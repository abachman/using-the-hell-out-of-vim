# Using the Hell Out of Vim

*A presentation in several parts*

## Part 1: Get Your Mind Right

In which I seek to establish the philosophical basis of tool use. One must
approach the practice with a right mind if learning is to result. Also, zealots
are a major bummer.

## Part 2: Basic Tool Use

In which I layout one possible introduction to the use of Vim through the
practical exploration of simple commands, common keys, and the various modes.
You hafta be there to really appreciate it, I suppose.

## Part 3: Extending the Tool

In which we explore the extension of Vim for one's own purposes. There truly
are many ways in which one may achieve enlightenment. I lay out some which have
worked for me.

## Part 4: Go, Therefore

Some final thoughts.
