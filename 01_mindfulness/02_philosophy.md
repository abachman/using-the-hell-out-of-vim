# Start Slowly

Start with the things you're already comfortable with, mouse, arrow keys, âŒ˜-s to save.

As much as possible, make no changes to your workflow.

# Small Changes

Adapt slowly, incrementally to vim's strange ways. Choose one thing you want to
learn, learn it, practice it.

# Change Yourself

Decide how you want to work, then work that way.

!SLIDE normal
# Change the Tool

Decide how you want vim to act, then make it act that way.

There's probably a plugin for the thing you're thinking of.
