# The Zealots Are Wrong

Invariably, the master vim users that were helping me make the switch would
encourage me to stick it out. "If you just give it a few weeks,
you'll never want to switch back."

The last few times someone tried to get me to switch to vim, I issued them a
simple challenge. Can you tell me a way to switch that will not significantly
reduce my productivity for the first few weeks?
